# OS-X-Ruby-Dev-Tools
Notes on setting up a set of Ruby development tools.

## Basic setup

* [Install Rails: A step-by-step guide][OneMonth] - Nice and straightforward, but version numbers are dated. Hard to tell if anyone is maintaining it. That said it worked without a hitch installing Ruby 2.4.0 and Rails 5 on OS X 10.12.4beta.
* [Install Ruby on Rails 5.0 Â· macOS Sierra][Kehoe] (last update: 29 Dec 2016) - Also helpful, somewhat more detail.

## Toolchain

* RVM
* Ruby (2.4.0)
* Rails (5.0.2)
* IntelliJ IDEA with Ruby plugin
* Global Gems:
  * minitest-reporter
  * RuboCop

## Tutorials and the like

* [Ruby On Rails Tutorial (Rails 5)][Hartl] - TDD (minitest) Rails tutorial
